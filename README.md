# Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for solving **confidence interval** problems and performing **hypothesis testing**.  
It is intended for educational purposes and for users who want a simple, hands-on way to understand statistical inference concepts.

---

## 📌 Overview

Statistical inference helps us draw conclusions about a population using sample data.  
This project focuses on two core ideas:

- **Confidence Intervals**
- **Hypothesis Testing**

The scripts in this repository demonstrate how these concepts can be implemented programmatically in Python.

---

## ✨ Features

- Calculate confidence intervals for sample statistics  
- Perform basic hypothesis tests  
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python code  
- Useful for statistics students and data science beginners

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### Confidence Interval
A confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain an unknown population parameter, such as a mean or proportion, with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

### Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to decide whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support or reject a claim about a population.

Typical steps include:
1. Defining null and alternative hypotheses  
2. Choosing a significance level (α)  
3. Computing a test statistic and p-value  
4. Making a decision based on the results

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

(Optional) Install required libraries if used in the script:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```

## 🧾 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gopal00NIraula/Confidence-Interval-and-Hypothesis-Tesiting.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd Confidence-Interval-and-Hypothesis-Tesiting
```

Run the script:
```bash
python Scripts.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform confidence interval calculations or hypothesis testing.

## 📊 Example Use Cases

- Estimate a population mean using a confidence interval  
- Test whether a population mean differs from a known value  
- Practice statistical inference concepts using Python  

---

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This project is best suited for:
- Statistics and data science students  
- Beginners learning hypothesis testing  
- Academic practice and demonstrations  

For advanced or production-level statistical analysis, consider using libraries such as **SciPy**, **statsmodels**, or **R**.
